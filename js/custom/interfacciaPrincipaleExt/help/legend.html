				This panel of the interface accomplished three heterogeneous tasks having a collapsible area each.
				The first area, namely “Legend” is a container for the legend associated with each layer. The area dynamically loads or unloads a legend according with the visibility of the layer in the map area.
				The following functional area named “Models” activates numerous models generated with Matlab and stored on the server.
				The web interface can activate these applications remotely also allowing the user to pass parameters required to perform the calculations.
				The results of calculations made by mathematical models are often tables containing arrays of values with the first column containing a code that uniquely identifies a critical infrastructure in the database.
				Using this code is always possible to link the output of the models, often a single value or an array of values, with any element of the database and represent the outcome of the model on the map.

				This tool can provide an additional analysis tool for managing risk by crossing information from different data sources and scattered in different places with the intent of analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information.

				The last panel named “JRC News” is a real time news aggregator of some services available within the JRC and related with risk. At the moment there are four planned connections only Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS) is already providing data:
