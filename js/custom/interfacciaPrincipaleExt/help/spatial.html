			<h2 class='manuale'>Selections of subset of networks</h2>
			<br>
			<p class='manuale'>
			In case of a catastrophic event is very unlikely that an entire network is affected, especially for networks that spans over an entire continent like Europe. More likely, due to the characteristic of both the event and the network, the effects will influence the elements of the network in the vicinity of the catastrophic event and will diminish with the increase of the distance from the event.
			In some cases is possible to evaluate this extent of effects automatically (using mathematical models) but in some other cases it can be more feasible to ask an expert judgment for a delineation of the likely area of impact.
			For this reason the GIS Platform has some methods for selecting data manually. 
			The choice of a selection method or another is left to the sensitivity of the analyst or expert who uses the system. The selections can be equated to the pencil used to trace the areas of interest on a paper map and although some examples are provided these examples are not to be considered in any way mandatory.

			<h2 class='manuale'>Select features individually</h2>
			<br>
			<p class='manuale'>
			This method allows selecting one or more nodes by clicking on them individually.
			This modality of selection can be used to select the starting point of a failure, an earthquake, a man made accident, etc…
			It is used to select the node which ignites a failure in the modeling procedure named “Metrics” and available in the GIS platform.

			<h2 class='manuale'>Select by Circle</h2>
			<br>
			<p class='manuale'>
			This is a two steps selection where the first step is the selection of the center point and then the value of the radius of a circle.
			This selection can be used anytime is necessary to apply an area of influence on a network in order to evaluate how many elements are within a certain distance from a specific point.
			The typical example can be a rapid assessment of how many power plants are within a certain distance from an earthquake. The resulting list of features selected can be then used for a preliminary assessment on possible damages and malfunctioning using a library of fragility curves

		  	<h2 class='manuale'>Select by Polygon</h2>
		  	<br>
			<p class='manuale'>
			With this tool is possible to select nodes and links between nodes by drawing a polygon delineating the area of interest containing a critical infrastructure network.
			This modality of selection can be used to select a sub-network from a network based on an expert judgment, similar areas (topographically, geologically, etc..). 
			It is used to select the part of the network is under study in the modeling procedure named “Metrics” and available in the GIS platform.

		  	<br>
			<p class='manuale'>
			In some cases is necessary or useful to perform a selection of a subset of an infrastructure based on administrative boundaries. The administrative boundaries changes according to the country and can be regions, districts, counties or even national areas.
			At the moment is possible to select the areas known as “Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics” level 2 or NUTS 2 areas which are basic regions for the application of regional policies.
