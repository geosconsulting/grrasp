				Window activates the tabular view of the data related to that layer, provided that the layer has data attached otherwise the window will be greyed and reactivated only when a valid dataset is selected.
				The data view is useful for having a holistic view of existing data visually presented in the map above. Using the tabular view the data can be edited (in order to amend possible errors for example), sorted clicking on the field header and filtered choosing the fields that must be shown and those that can be omitted from the view. The creation of new data is conversely demanded to additional tools and procedures explained later in this document.
				The data view is hidden when the platform first starts but can be enlarged whenever necessary by clicking the arrows at the right end side of the window bar or on the window bar itself.
