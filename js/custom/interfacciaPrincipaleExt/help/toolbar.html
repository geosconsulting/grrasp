			All the procedures and actions can be commanded through the toolbar positioned at the top the Map View. Some of the tools can be used jointly with others whilst others require an exclusive control on the interface. The first time the portal is loaded by the user it will be necessary to login for viewing, exporting, importing and querying data. Thereafter until the user does not explicitly logoff the data will be available without restrictions.	</p><br>
