				A GIS is a system of hardware and software used for storage, retrieval, mapping, and analysis of geographic data.  Spatial features are stored in a coordinate system (latitude/longitude, state plane, UTM, etc.), which references a particular place on the earth.  Descriptive attributes in tabular form are associated with spatial features.
				There are two major components of any GIS system, the graphical component and the database component. The graphical component deals with representation of real world infrastructures abstracted to punctual, linear and areal geometries. For example, a street or road can be graphically represented by a line and a power plant with a point.
				The database component deals with the attributes connected to any graphical component and describing the component. For example width or numbers of lanes are two of the numerous attributes that can be linked to a road.

				The GIS prepared for this specific project is served through a webGIS platform enabling the delivers of maps and analysis on the World Wide Web.
				The webGIS interface aims to be “dashboard” capable of interacting with all the procedures involved in the risk management, from data management to the generation of topologies, from the interaction with mathematical analyses to the visualization of these analyses.

			<p class='manuale'>
				All the software used in the GIS Platform is Open Source using either a GPL (GNU General Public License), BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) or MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) licensing.
				The GIS platform is composed of four modules as visible in Figure 3.

				The “Data Management” and “Data Processing” modules respectively have the task of pre-processing data and then use those data for performing analyzes.
			
				Data management entails an innumerable list of activities such as data validation and quality check, data conversion and any other process useful to obtain a complete compliance with the Inspire directive (2007/2/EC).
		
				Data processing is the pivotal process for transforming “raw data” into meaningful and comprehensible information. In most cases this transformation is obtained using programming languages and software packages with strong mathematical and scientific analysis capabilities such as Matlab and Python.
