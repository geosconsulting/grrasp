			<h2 class='manuale'>Multi-Hazard Risk Assessment: Scenario Builder</h2>
			<br>
			<p class='manuale'>
			The Scenario Builder guides the user step by step in the creation of a procedure that uses the procedure known as SMCE (Spatial Multiple Criteria Evaluation) which is an implementation of the Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) but with a substantial use of data and indicators spatially located. 
			In the evaluation field, multi-criteria analysis is usually an ex ante evaluation tool, and is particularly used for the examination of the intervention’s strategic choices.  
			The Scenario Builder is a decision-making tool developed for assessing the risk to which a critical infrastructure is exposed related to a specific hazard in situations where multiple criteria are involved and confusion can arise if a logical, well-structured decision-making process is not followed.
			This tool tries to answer questions like “What percentage of the sewer network will be affected in case of earthquake with a return period of one hundred years within a radius of 25 km?”
			The development of the tool is still in the early stage of development and will be one of the main tasks to be investigated in a three years research.

			<h2 class='manuale'>Hazard Assessment</h2>
			<br>
			<p class='manuale'>
			Many attempts have been made to categorize hazards, like Smith (1991) who identifies three distinct classes:
			</p><br>
		  	 <ul class="lista">
				<li>
			    Natural Hazards (extreme geophysical and biological events) 	
				<li>
				Technological Hazards (major accidents) 
				</li>
				<li>
				Context hazards (global change)
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br><br>
			<p class='manuale'>
			In any case each classification system, however, presents some ambiguities in the subdivision of hazard in categories. Therefore, the hazards considered in the scenario builder are those that have a spatial component, geo-hazards, which have a short onset time and an extension defined geographical thus excluding all the changing long-term such as climate change or affecting areas very extended and not demarcated as the desertification of large parts of southern Europe.
			Spatially, hazard is expressed as areas representing temporal probability or return period which is an estimate of the likelihood of an event, such as an earthquake, flood or a river discharge flow to occur.
			The EU has in the past commissioned and funded many projects that had as its primary objective the creations of risk maps for different hazards and different return period. Additionally, each member state has developed methodologies of risk management which entails a first stage of mapping..
			One example among many is the European Flood Directive (EFD) sets out the requirement for the Member States to develop flood mapping comprising of flood hazard maps and flood risk maps. Flood hazard maps cover the geographical areas which could be flooded according to the following scenarios:
			</p>
			<br>
			 <ul class="lista">
				<li>
			    floods with a low probability, or extreme event scenarios; 	
				<li>
				floods with a medium probability (likely return period ≥ 100 years);
				</li>
				<li>
				floods with a high probability, where appropriate.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p class='manuale'>
			For each scenario referred to in paragraph 3 the following elements shall be shown:
			</p>
			<br>
			 <ul class="lista">
				<li>
			    the flood extent;
				<li>
			    water depths or water level, as appropriate;
				</li>
				<li>
				where appropriate, the flow velocity or the relevant water flow.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p class='manuale'>
			In case data were not available or deemed of insufficient accuracy is always possible to perform studies for a specific location using established methodologies or use historical series to derive extent and intensities of specific hazards.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2 class='manuale'>Hazard Assessment</h2>
			<br>
			<p class='manuale'>
		    The GIS Platform is focused on European Critical Infrastructures (ECI) hence infrastructures which are of the highest importance for the Community and which if disrupted or destroyed would affect two or more MS, or a single Member State if the critical infrastructure is located in another Member State. 
			This includes transboundary effects resulting from interdependencies between interconnected infrastructures across various sectors. 
			The procedure for the identification and designation of European Critical Infrastructures (ECI), and a common approach to the assessment of the needs to improve the protection of such infrastructures will be established by means of a Directive.
			In any case models developed within the GIS Platform for ECI can transparently be reused for managing National Critical Infrastructures (NCI) whose management falls on the NCI owners/operators and on the Member States. 
			Following one of the key principles of the EPCIP the infrastructures the approach for selecting the infrastructures will be sector-by-sector based because it would be impossible the collect in one singular place all the necessary experience, expertise and requirements of any sector involved in critical infrastructure protections.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2 class='manuale'>Vulnerability Assessment</h2>
			<br>
			<p class='manuale'>
		  	Here we want to estimate only physical and no calculations are executed to assess social, economic or environmental vulnerability. Physical vulnerability measures the potential losses to a given element as a result from the occurrence of a natural phenomenon of a given magnitude and expressed on a scale from 0 (no damage) to 1 (total damage). 
			The vulnerability assessment is carried out for infrastructures looking for tangible losses. The basic method used is the application of damage-state curves, also called loss functions or vulnerability curves (Smith, 1994).
			The inventory of infrastructures containing information of the construction technologies and value of each infrastructure is used in combination with various hazard maps for different return periods to generate vulnerability maps for a specific area.
			Because the GIS Platform is intended as a tool that can support experts in planning risk mitigation policies we favor methods that use indicators for vulnerability and are based on expert opinion.
			The methodology is still under development but is based on the approaches that can be found in the definition within the disaster risk framework by Davidson (1997), the triangle of risk of Villagrán de Lèon (2004) and the UN/ISDR framework for risk reduction (2004). This school of thinking, the disaster risk community, defines vulnerability as a component within the contest of hazard and risk. This school usually views vulnerability, coping capacity and exposure as separate features (Birkmann, 2006).
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class='manuale'>
			Once the hazard maps have been calculated and the vulnerability of critical infrastructures under scrutiny has been individuated is possible to perform a risk analysis for multiple or single hazards (Figure 25 - Cees Van Westen - Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation – University of Twente – The Netherlands)
			With spatially enabled risk analysis is possible to achieve a fairly accurate estimation and quantification of the probability of losses (absolute risk) as well as qualitative risk assessment where each feature is categorized into a low, moderate or high level of risk.
			Due the heterogeneity of the construction methods and accounting systems in Europe the latter is probably the most immediately usable for further costs or cost-benefits analysis.
			In case of a qualitative risk assessment can be calculated with:
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2 class='manuale'>RS = PT  * P L * V * A</h2>
			<br>
			<ul class="lista">
				<li>
			    PT is the temporal (e.g. annual) probability of occurrence of a specific hazard scenario (Hs) with a given return period in an area;
				<li>
			    PL is the locational or spatial probability of occurrence of a specific hazard scenario with a given return period in an area impacting the elements-at-risk;
				</li>
				<li>
				V is the physical vulnerability, specified as the degree of damage to a specific element-at-risk Es given the local intensity caused due to the occurrence of hazard scenario Hs
				</li>
				<li>
				A is the quantification (value) of the specific type of element at risk evaluated. 
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p class='manuale'>
			 If the value is expressed in monetary terms, the risk may also be expressed as potential damage.
			 In case of multiple damaging phenomena is necessary to calculate risk for each hazard type calculating the annual risk curves and then determine the total risk.
