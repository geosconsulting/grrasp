				Clicking the third button in the toolbar, the window containing all the available information layers will be shown(Figure 12).
				The layer can be selected clicking on its name, viewed selecting the checkbox on the far left or selected for removal from the view using the circular selection tool on the immediate left of the layer’s name.
				The first action will fetch the data linked to the layer, the second will make the data visible on the map whilst the third will make the layer available for deletion using the second button of the toolbar.
				The window has two controls located at the bottom of the windo itself. The first one- “Remove Layer” -  removes the layer selected while the “Zoom to Layer” restrict the extent of the map to the extent of the layer.
