			Geographic data available in the platform can be broadly divided into three categories:				
			</p><br>
		    <ul class="lista">
				<li>
					Static spatial data stored locally (e.g. same server hosting the platform)
				</li>
				<li>
					Static spatial data stored remotely(e.g. a different server from the one hosting the platform) and dynamic real time data (e.g. the data are provided by remote servers often but not always storing their geographical position)
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<p class='manuale'><br><br>
			The two type share many similarities but have a different degree of usability.
			The locally stored data can be viewed, selected and edited (e.g. add new data or delete old ones) whilst the remotely stored data are subjected to the restrictions put in places by the data owner and administrators and are usable for visualization purposes, are in some cases selectable but cannot be edited.
			For some of the locally stored data is meaningless to provide the possibility to change the data (e.g. borders of the European countries) for this reason the tools provided for editing data are available only for network related datasets while all the rest of the dataset provided by the platform are changed or updated only by the administrator of the site.
			Dynamic data are also not changeable and can have an even more strict usability policies and due to their special nature are in some cases are not spatially located and are presented as a list of events (see Figure 6).
			They represent threats posed to the critical infrastructure such as earthquakes, flooded areas, adverse weather conditions, etc... 
			The last type of data are sometimes subject to failure or can be not reachable for limited or extended period of time due to problems in the remote servers. This unavailability does not affect the overall usability of the platform which can be on the other hand seriously limited because this data are in general used as the starting point of any further analysis.
