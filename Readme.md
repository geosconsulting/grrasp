RASP can be used for the analysis of complex networked systems taking into consideration cross-sectoral and cross-border interdependencies. It can be used for analyses of CI disruptions at local, regional, national, international level. GRRASP follows a tiered approach according to which Tier 1 modules can be used for the analysis of critical infrastructures at sectoral level, Tier 2 modules for cross-sectoral analyses (interdependencies), and finally Tier 3 modules for high level economic impact of CI disruption at state level.
